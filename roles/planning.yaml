# planning.yaml - Planning and architecture role with full research stack
#
# This role provides agents and tools optimized for:
# - Extensive planning with literature search (ToolUniverse, EuropePMC, PubMed)
# - Cross-model consensus via PAL (Claude ↔ Gemini collaboration)
# - Codebase exploration and semantic search (Serena)
# - Implementation planning from existing work
# - Biological interpretation of analysis goals
#
# MCP Profile: full
#   - PAL: Cross-model collaboration, consensus building, deep thinking
#   - ToolUniverse: 600+ scientific tools (literature, drug, protein DBs)
#   - Serena: Semantic code search and symbol navigation
#   - Context7: Library documentation
#   - Sequential-thinking: Structured reasoning
#
# Best used when:
# - Starting new analysis phases requiring literature review
# - Planning refactoring of existing pipelines
# - Making architectural decisions needing multi-model input
# - Heavy research tasks delegated to Gemini via PAL clink
