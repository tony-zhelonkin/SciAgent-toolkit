description: "DecoupleR activity inference pipeline -- infers transcription factor activities (ULM + CollecTRI regulatory network) and signaling pathway activities (MLM + PROGENy consensus signatures, 14 canonical pathways: JAK-STAT, MAPK, NFkB, PI3K, TGFb, TNFa, EGFR, WNT, p53, Hypoxia, Androgen, Estrogen, Trail, VEGF) from bulk RNA-seq DE results, plus publication-quality visualization. Use when computing TF or pathway activity scores from limma/edgeR DE output, identifying differentially active transcription factors, building master_tf_activities.csv or master_progeny_activities.csv, or generating barplots/volcanos/target-gene scatter plots. Routes to: references/tf-activity.md (DecoupleR ULM + CollecTRI), references/progeny.md (PROGENy MLM), references/visualization.md (barplots, volcanos, scatter).

# Bulk RNA-seq Activity Inference (DecoupleR)

## Overview

This skill covers footprint-based activity inference from bulk RNA-seq DE results — a method family that is complementary to, not a replacement for, GSEA. Where GSEA asks "is this gene set enriched in my ranked list?", activity inference asks "which regulator or signaling program drove the expression changes I observe?"

Two inference tools share the same DecoupleR framework and OmniPath data infrastructure:

| Tool | Network | Method | Output | Scale |
|------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| **TF activity** | CollecTRI (literature + ChIP) | ULM (weighted linear model) | Per-TF activity score | ~500-1500 TFs |
| **PROGENy** | Consensus footprints | MLM (multivariate linear model) | Per-pathway activity score | 14 canonical pathways |

Both are run in parallel, not as alternatives. Their outputs feed the same visualization layer and the same interactive pathway explorer.

**When to use this skill:**
- Inferring which transcription factors are differentially active between conditions
- Computing signaling pathway activity changes for the 14 canonical PROGENy pathways
- Building `master_tf_activities.csv` and `master_progeny_activities.csv`
- Visualizing activity results (barplots, volcano, target-gene scatter, direction summary)

**When NOT to use this skill:**
- Gene set enrichment against MSigDB, MitoCarta, TransportDB, or GO → use `bulk-rnaseq-gsea`
- Interactive UMAP pathway explorer (consumes the master CSVs this skill produces) → use `bulk-rnaseq-pathway-explorer`
- Topology-aware metabolic module discovery → use `gatom-metabolomic-predictions`

## Decision Tree

```
Need to understand regulatory activity from DE results?
|
+-- Want TF activity scores (which transcription factors are active)?
|   --> references/tf-activity.md
|       Tool: DecoupleR ULM + CollecTRI
|       Output: score per TF (+ p-value), master_tf_activities.csv
|       Key patterns: t-stat input, minsize=5, cache network, BH correction
|
+-- Want signaling pathway activity (14 canonical pathways)?
|   --> references/progeny.md
|       Tool: DecoupleR MLM + PROGENy (top=500 for bulk)
|       Output: 14 rows, master_progeny_activities.csv
|       Key patterns: .mor="weight" not "mor", no MTC needed at n=14
|
+-- Have master CSVs, need static publication figures?
|   --> references/visualization.md
|       Covers: barplot, volcano, direction summary, target-gene scatter
|       Key patterns: 4-category TF chart, significance stars for PROGENy,
|                     ggplot2 4.0 NA-color fix, symmetric NES scale
|
+-- Have master CSVs, need interactive HTML exploration?
    --> bulk-rnaseq-pathway-explorer (standalone skill)
```

*TF and PROGENy inference are independent — run them in parallel (scripts 1.7 and 1.8 have no dependency between them).*

## Quick Start

Minimal TF activity inference + PROGENy in one session:

```r
library(decoupleR)
library(dplyr)

# Shared input: t-statistic matrix (genes x contrasts)
de_results <- readRDS("03_results/checkpoints/1.1_de_results.rds")
deg_table  <- de_results[["IL2RAKO_vs_NTC"]]
mat        <- deg_table %>% dplyr::select(t) %>% as.matrix()
mat[is.na(mat)] <- 0

# --- TF activity (ULM + CollecTRI) ---
net_tf <- decoupleR::get_collectri(organism = "mouse", split_complexes = FALSE)
tf_acts <- decoupleR::run_ulm(
  mat = mat, net = net_tf,
  .source = "source", .target = "target", .mor = "mor",
  minsize = 5
) %>% filter(condition == "t")

stopifnot(nrow(tf_acts) >= 50)
message("TF activity: ", nrow(tf_acts), " TFs inferred")

# --- PROGENy (MLM + PROGENy footprints) ---
net_pg <- decoupleR::get_progeny(organism = "mouse", top = 500)
pathway_acts <- decoupleR::run_mlm(
  mat = mat, net = net_pg,
  .source = "source", .target = "target", .mor = "weight",
  minsize = 5
) %>% filter(condition == "t")

stopifnot(nrow(pathway_acts) == 14)
message("PROGENy: 14 pathway activity scores")
```

## Pipeline Architecture

### Execution order

```
1.1  core_pipeline.R           -> DE results (prerequisite for both)
1.7  decoupler_tf_analysis.R   -> TF activity inference + master_tf_activities.csv
1.8  progeny_analysis.R        -> PROGENy inference + master_progeny_activities.csv
2.3  tf_viz.R                  -> TF visualization (barplot, volcano, direction, histogram)
2.4  progeny_viz.R             -> PROGENy visualization (barplot, volcano, target scatter)
3.1  pathway_explorer.py       -> Interactive HTML (consumes master_tf + master_progeny CSVs)
```

Scripts 1.7 and 1.8 can run in parallel. Scripts 2.3 and 2.4 can run in parallel.

### Data flow

```
limma-voom DE results (gene symbols as rownames, t-statistic)
    |
    +-- DecoupleR ULM  + CollecTRI  -> TF activity scores  -> master_tf_activities.csv
    |                                                              |
    +-- DecoupleR MLM  + PROGENy    -> 14 pathway scores   -> master_progeny_activities.csv
                                                                   |
                           Static figures (R/ggplot2) <------------+
                           Interactive explorer (Python/Plotly UMAP) <-- both CSVs
```

## Key Differences: TF Activity vs PROGENy

| Aspect | TF Activity (ULM) | PROGENy (MLM) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Network | CollecTRI (TF→target, literature+ChIP) | PROGENy consensus footprints |
| Method | Univariate linear model per TF | Multivariate linear model |
| Weight type | ±1 + intermediate MoR | Continuous signed weights |
| Scale | Hundreds of TFs | Exactly 14 pathways |
| MTC needed | Yes (BH correction) | No (n=14 tests) |
| Column for .mor | `"mor"` | `"weight"` |
| Primary use | "Which TF drives this?" | "Which canonical signal changed?" |

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] **TF count reasonable:** 100-1500 TFs with `minsize=5`. Under 50 = symbol mismatch with network.
- [ ] **PROGENy count exact:** `nrow(pathway_acts) == 14`. Any other count = network/filtering problem.
- [ ] **Activity centered near 0:** `abs(mean(tf_acts$score)) < 5`; strong bias suggests input matrix issue.
- [ ] **Known biology check:** For IL-2 signaling experiments, STAT5 (TF) and JAK-STAT (PROGENy) should show activity.
- [ ] **Master CSVs written:** `master_tf_activities.csv` and `master_progeny_activities.csv` exist in `03_results/tables/`.
- [ ] **PROGENY_ prefix:** All PROGENy `pathway_id` values start with `PROGENY_`.
- [ ] **Visualization complete:** Per-output PDFs exist in `plots/TF/` and `plots/PROGENy/`.

## Common Pitfalls (Cross-Stage)

| Symptom | Stage | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|
| Under 50 TFs inferred | TF | Gene symbol mismatch with CollecTRI | `sum(rownames(mat) %in% net$target)` should be thousands |
| `run_mlm` wrong .mor | PROGENy | Used `.mor = "mor"` instead of `.mor = "weight"` | PROGENy network column is named `weight` |
| padj = pvalue for TFs | TF | No BH correction applied | `p.adjust(tf_acts$p_value, method = "BH")` |
| Volcano points missing | Viz | `color = NA` on shape 21 (ggplot2 4.0+) | Use `stroke = 0` or `color = "transparent"` |
| Network download timeout | Both | OmniPath unreachable | Cache network on first download with `saveRDS()` |

For full pitfall walkthroughs → see the relevant reference document.
