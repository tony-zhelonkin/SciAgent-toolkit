# Troubleshooting playbook (append-only)

This file grows as agents encounter novel failure modes across the scvi-tools cluster. The format is deliberately minimal: **symptom → cause → fix**, optionally with a code snippet.

> Append new entries at the bottom. Do not delete or reorder — this is a log, not a reference tree.

## Entries

### Training stalls with no GPU utilization

**Cause:** PyTorch CPU wheel installed despite a CUDA-capable GPU.
**Fix:**
```bash
pip uninstall torch scvi-tools
pip install -U "scvi-tools[cuda]"
python -c "import torch; assert torch.cuda.is_available()"
```
**Applies to:** all
**Seen:** 2026-04-20, initial seed

### KeyError on gene names when loading query data

**Cause:** Query `var_names` are Ensembl IDs while reference was trained on gene symbols (or vice versa).
**Fix:** Harmonize before `prepare_query_anndata`:
```python
query_adata.var_names = query_adata.var["gene_symbol"].astype(str)
query_adata.var_names_make_unique()
```
**Applies to:** scArches on any model
**Seen:** 2026-04-20, initial seed

### Latent space collapses to a single cluster

**Cause:** Training stopped too early (early_stopping triggered on a noisy validation curve) or `n_latent` was set too low.
**Fix:** Raise `early_stopping_patience` to 60+, raise `n_latent` to 20–30, and plot `model.history["elbo_train"]` to confirm convergence.
**Applies to:** scVI, scANVI, MultiVI
**Seen:** 2026-04-20, initial seed
