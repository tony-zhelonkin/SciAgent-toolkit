description: Seurat unpaired RNA-ATAC integration via gene-activity anchoring — CCA-based FindTransferAnchors, TransferData label transfer, and exploratory RNA expression imputation for ATAC cells. Use when you have separate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq experiments (NOT true multiome) and no bridge dataset. For paired multiome use signac-chromatin-analysis; for the Python / scGLUE equivalent use scglue-unpaired-multiomics-integration.

# Seurat Unpaired Cross-Modality Integration

## Overview

When you have **separate** scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq experiments from the
same biological system (but not the same cells), Seurat can transfer
labels between them by treating the gene-activity matrix from ATAC as a
proxy for RNA. CCA is used to find shared structure in this synthetic
shared feature space.

**When to reach for this skill:**
- No paired multiome data, no bridge dataset.
- Gene-activity matrix already computed in the ATAC object (via
  `Signac::GeneActivity()`).
- You want cell-type labels transferred from an RNA reference onto the
  ATAC cells, or RNA expression imputed for the ATAC cells.

**When NOT to reach for this skill:**
- Paired multiome — use `signac-chromatin-analysis` (WNN is strictly
  better when both modalities are on the same cell).
- A multiome bridge dataset is available — use
  `seurat-bridge-integration`.
- The Python ecosystem is preferred — use
  `scglue-unpaired-multiomics-integration`.

## Part 1 — Find CCA transfer anchors

```r
# Gene activity must already exist in atac_obj's "RNA" slot
# (i.e. assigned via atac_obj[["RNA"]] <- GeneActivity-based assay)

DefaultAssay(rna_ref) <- "RNA"
DefaultAssay(atac_obj) <- "RNA"   # gene activity scores

rna_ref <- FindVariableFeatures(rna_ref, nfeatures = 3000)

transfer.anchors <- FindTransferAnchors(
  reference        = rna_ref,
  query            = atac_obj,
  features         = VariableFeatures(rna_ref),
  reference.assay  = "RNA",
  query.assay      = "RNA",       # gene-activity scores
  reduction        = "cca",       # CCA for cross-modality (NOT rpca)
  dims             = 1:30,
)
```

**Critical:** use `reduction = "cca"`. `rpca` does not handle the
modality gap and gives near-random anchors.

---

## Part 2 — Transfer labels

```r
predictions <- TransferData(
  anchorset         = transfer.anchors,
  refdata           = rna_ref$cell_annotations,
  weight.reduction  = atac_obj[["lsi"]],
  dims              = 2:30,       # skip LSI 1 (depth-correlated)
)

atac_obj <- AddMetaData(atac_obj, predictions)

# QC: well-anchored cells have prediction.score.max > 0.5
sum(atac_obj$prediction.score.max > 0.5) / ncol(atac_obj)
```

The `weight.reduction = atac_obj[["lsi"]]` argument tells Seurat to use
the ATAC native embedding (not gene activity) when weighting anchors —
this preserves ATAC-resolved structure.

---

## Part 3 — Expression imputation (exploratory)

```r
refdata <- GetAssayData(rna_ref, assay = "RNA", layer = "data")[
              VariableFeatures(rna_ref), ]

imputation <- TransferData(
  anchorset         = transfer.anchors,
  refdata           = refdata,
  weight.reduction  = atac_obj[["lsi"]],
  dims              = 2:30,
)

atac_obj[["imputed_RNA"]] <- imputation
```

Imputed expression is suitable for **population-level** TF-gene
hypotheses, not single-cell regulatory dynamics.

---

## Part 4 — Quality and limitations

| What works well | What does NOT |
|---|---|
| Label transfer (~90 % accuracy on Ma et al. benchmark) | Single-cell-resolution regulatory inference |
| Co-embedding in a shared UMAP | Rare cell states (too few anchors) |
| Population-level gene signatures | Enhancer-driven expression (gene activity misses distal regulation) |
| Validation layer for ChromVAR TF activity | Dynamic range — variance is compressed |

**For GRN inference:** Imputed expression is suitable for
population-level TF-gene relationships but NOT single-cell regulatory
dynamics. For publication-quality GRN, use the SCENIC+ metacell approach
(`scenic-grn-inference`). Seurat imputation can serve as a validation
layer for SCENIC+ eRegulons.

**Benchmark reference:** Ma et al., Genome Biology 2023 — Seurat and
scGLUE were the top two methods for unpaired RNA+ATAC integration.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Random-looking label transfer | Confirm `reduction = "cca"`, not `"rpca"`. |
| All `prediction.score.max` near 0 | Variable features in reference not present in gene-activity matrix; recompute gene activity with a matching annotation. |
| Imputed expression is smooth-looking | Expected — gene activity is already smoothed; do not over-interpret single-cell patterns. |
| LSI component 1 sneaks back in | Always pass `dims = 2:30` to `TransferData` when using `weight.reduction = atac_obj[["lsi"]]`. |

## API quick reference

```r
# Anchor finding
FindTransferAnchors(reference, query, features, reduction = "cca",
                    reference.assay, query.assay, dims = 1:30)

# Label / expression transfer
TransferData(anchorset, refdata, weight.reduction = obj[["lsi"]],
             dims = 2:30)
```
